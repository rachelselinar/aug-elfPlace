=======================================================================================
                     Updated Bookshelf Format for FPGA Placement
=======================================================================================

This document explains the bookshelf files for [Titan23 benchmarks](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~kmurray/titan.html) generated by [VPR](https://docs.verilogtorouting.org/en/latest/vpr/). The fixed IO/PLL locations are from the VPR placer, and the design information and clustered DSP/memory blocks are from the VPR packer.

1a. Header (.aux file):
  - Lists all the files containing design and architecture information;
  - This mode uses net weights for carry chains;

1b. CC Header (.cc.aux file):
  - Lists all the files containing design and architecture information;
  - Reads in additional 'design.cc' file with carry chain information;
  - This mode uses a partial macro approach for carry chains;

2. Library cell (.lib file):
  - Each instance has a corresponding master library cell and is defined in the nodes file;
  - All library cells are defined in the design.lib along with cell pin information;
  - Each instance has the same number of pins as defined in its master cell;
  - Not all the pins of an instance are used. Some are left unconnected;
  - Library file defines specific attributes associated with pins: direction, clock, and control;

3. Nodes (.nodes file):
  - Each design instance, along with its master library cell, is listed;

4. Nets (.nets file):
  - Each net is a collection of node pins;

5. Weights (.wts file):
  - Specifies the net name and net weight;
  - Default net weight is 1.0;

6. Carry Chains (.cc file):
  - Lists all carry chains in the design consisting of the root node and other nodes in order;
  - Used with the cc header mode;

7. Placement file (.pl file)
  - The location of an instance has three fields: x-coord, y-coord (to determine the SITE), and index within the SITE;
  - Input placement file in benchmarks only contains locations of fixed instances (IO/PLL, etc), which are not allowed to change during placement;
  - Placer's output placement file should contain locations of all instances;

8. Layout (.scl file)
  - There are two sections in the layout file: the site definition section and the site map section;
  - SITE definition specifies available resources (LUT/FF/memory/DSP) that can be placed in one site;
  - RESOURCES specifies cell names that correspond to specific resources;
  - SITEMAP specifies the two-dimension array of sites for the entire device/chip:

5. Legality Constraints file (.lc file)
  - SITEPERCOLUMN specifies if the architecture is column-based;
  - SITEDIMENSIONS and CELLDIMENSIONS provide the width and height of the available site and instance types on the FPGA;
  - SLICEUNIT, LUTFRACTURE, FFSLICE, FFSLICEUNIT, and FFCTRLS specify the LUT and FF legality constraints within a SLICE;
  - WLWEIGHT (OPTIONAL) allows the x- and y-direction wirelength computation to be weighted;
  - ROUTECAP provides the unit pin capacity and the unit horizontal/vertical routing capacity for the FPGA;
  - SITEOUT specifies the output format for writing the flat placement solution to VPR.
